/* There is a certain way that you need to code in order for the computer
 * to recognize what someone is trying to create with their code. Syntax
 * is the structure of the coding language and conventions are different
 * ways we can access different items in a compound item in the code. Semi-colons
 * need to be placed at the end of your statements to tell the computer "this is
 * the end of this action" comments are a great way to show others what is happening
 * or even to remind yourself of what something in your code it doing. You can do a single
 * line comment with a double slash or a multi line comment with the slash and astarisk at the
 * beginning and reversing it to end the comment. You can also use it to disable code just in case
 * it doesnt work.
