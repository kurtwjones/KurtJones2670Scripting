Variables have an access modifyer that says who can access it. private 
only allows class in which it is called to access it. Unity can only see 
public variables in its GUI. Next the variable can have a modifier like const.
Then your variable needs a data type like int, double or bool. An identifier
is a name that you call your variable. There are certain words you cant use
for an identifier. It can't contradict the api, start with a number or
contain two or more words. finally you assign it a value then end with
a semi colon. Exposed variables are contained in unity and can be changed
which will over ride your value in your script.
